## Control Pico with Caps Lock Key

[code.py](code.py) is a CircuitPython program tested on a Pico W.

The Pico is connected via a USB cable to a computer and acting as a keyboard.

This program uses the CAPS_LOCK status to control the starting and pausing of the program.

NOTE: It may be possible to use NUMS_LOCK as well as an additional control mechanism.
